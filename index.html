    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Leah Phomsouvandara was born on October 31, 2002, and has been creating ever since she could hold a pencil. She’s currently studying Studio Practice at San José State University, where she’s been exploring all kinds of art—from digital to physical and everything in between. Leah originally thought she’d stick with graphic design, but the more she experimented, the more she fell in love with hands-on making—especially sculpture. This portfolio shows where she’s at now: diving into digital media while still holding on to that satisfying feeling of building something real with her own hands.

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      This series started with me just playing around—literally opening image files in a text editor and breaking the code on purpose. I didn’t follow a strict plan; I just kept experimenting, messing things up, and seeing how the visuals glitched. The more I messed with it, the more I found these unexpected, beautiful distortions. It felt like turning digital mistakes into art.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite glitches became the base for an album cover I designed using AI tools and Photoshop. I wanted it to feel emotional and raw, like the sound of a lo-fi track that hits late at night. This whole project was about exploring the beauty in brokenness and just trusting the process—even if it starts with chaos.

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      This little character started as a quick photo I took with a city view in the background. I brought it into Adobe Illustrator and used vector anchor points to recreate the image piece by piece—kind of like digital tracing, but with way more attention to shape and detail. Once I got the look just right, I turned it into a sticker and printed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coolest part? I got to place the final stickers on real items—laptops, water bottles, and anything that needed a little personality. It was such a fun process seeing something I made digitally turn into a real physical thing people can actually use and carry around.

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      For this project, I coded a custom robot using p5.js. I started with basic rectangles, then built the robot’s body from stacked shapes—head, torso, and base. To bring it to life, I added a smooth bounce animation using sine wave logic, giving it a cute little wiggle as it moves. Every part of the robot was made by adjusting positions with math and code, and it was really satisfying to see it all come together from scratch.

    <p>
      This was my first time mixing creativity with JavaScript code, and it felt like I was both drawing and engineering at the same time—one line of code at a time.

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>
      For this project, I created a simple GIF of my face to experiment with basic animation. I started by taking a photo and editing it into a looping motion using a GIF-making tool. I wanted something playful and personal—so using my own face felt right. After making the GIF, I built a blog page to go with it, where I talked about the history of GIFs and their impact on digital culture. I added images, styled the page with CSS, and embedded my GIF to show it in action. This project let me combine visual storytelling with coding and gave me a better understanding of how creative and flexible GIFs can be on the web.
